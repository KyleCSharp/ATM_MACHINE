# ATM_MACHINE
This is an ATM Windows form application that is going to represent as close I can get to a real atm machine without a database may add a database later for currentAmount = 0 so that can be updated and stay updated even when the application closes we shall see updated regularly  this is a work in progress.
 for demonstration purposes the pin to login to the bank ATM is "1234"
